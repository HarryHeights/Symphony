**Why the name “Symphony”?**

Partly because [AndreasK](https://gitlab.com/AndreasK/unpopular-music-player) used the much better name [“Unpopular Music Player”](https://f-droid.org/packages/de.kromke.andreas.unpopmusicplayerfree/).

Songs can be searched only by genres or album in which they are categorized.
